867;Yordan;Yordan is a 35-year-old Roma living in Sliven, Bulgaria.  For the last 10 years, Yordan has supported his wife and two children (aged 14 and 17) by his work with walnuts.  Yordan drives around Bulgaria buying walnuts in their shells by the sack.  Upon his return to Sliven, he weighs the sacks and gives each to one of his independent contractors.  The contractor removes the walnuts from their shells and returns the shelled walnuts to Yordan.  Weighing the sacks before their distribution lets Yordan know approximately how many kilos of shelled nuts should be returned, to prevent his contractors from siphoning off his nuts.  Yordan provides work for approx 50 people for 5 days when he brings in a load of nuts to be shelled.  Yordan then sells his walnuts at the major nut markets in Sofia and Burgas.  <p>\r\n\r\nCurrently, Yordan can afford to buy 2,000BGN (1,300USD) worth of walnuts at a time, which he sells 10 days later for 2,500BGN (1,625USD).  After salaries and expenses (gas for his van to drive around Bulgaria buying and selling the nuts), Yordan nets approximately 200BGN (130USD), which he can do every two weeks or so.  This loan will give him the capital to increase the amount of nuts he can buy at a time (nearly double), employing more people in the Roma ghetto of Sliven.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe Roma, commonly referred to as gypsies, is a severely marginalized social group in the Balkans.  \r\n\r\n;;Working capital;BG;Bulgaria;Sliven;standard;;3;19;12;;Yordan;male;true;monthly;field_partner

970;Joan;"\r\nJoan is 33 years old, married and has two children. Her family depends on a small piece of land where she grows vegetables and beans. Joan has benefited from the group and WEEC by accessing small loans and this has increased her capacity to look after her family without relying on her husband. She is a dedicated agri-business woman; she applies the business skills she has attained over the years from group trainings to make money from what she produces. The following gives her income: sale of milk, tealeaves and vegetables from her small farm. For some time, she has been selling Napier grass from a rented small piece of land. From her farming, she is able to earn about USD150 monthly but this is not enough to sustain her family. \r\nRight now she plans to rent a bigger plot of land to plant more Napier grass vegetables for sale. As the business grows, she wants to buy another dairy cow to increase milk production. Joan is optimistic that she will get a break through and live a happy life. \r\n";;Joan would like to rent a plot of land to grow vegetables and Napier grass for sale;KE;Kenya;Kangema;standard;;6;12;3;;Joan;female;true;monthly;field_partner

2767;Victor;Victor R. has 25 years of experience selling shoes, clothes, and he started working in Bahia, Ecuador. He worked for a boss who had the idea to work on foot and sell shoes in the local pueblos. After breaking off from this small business, Victor and his wife decided they would go into business together, and they followed a similar model from Victor’s previous job. They had success early on because they knew exactly whichi towns were the most lucrative, and they offered promotions to the best buyers, whom they knew personally. Each day they work from 5am until 10pm. They have recently been so focused on sales that they have not had the time to replenish their inventory with new stock, so they sell goods in the morning and then use the proceeds from those sales to buy just enough shoes to still sell in the afternoon. Victor’s wife is a great salesperson, and she typically goes to the small towns and local festivals which occur fairly often. They have two grown children who help sell their goods, and the family unit has maintained strong over the years. Their house is their greatest collateral. \r\n\r\nVictor needs this loan so that he can increase the volume of shoes and clothing  in stock to sell when the Riveras go to market.  He is a 48 year-old with four children, who of whom work for the family business. His wife is his right hand, and he could not do anything without her. She is responsible for the finances, taking care of the house, and looking after the children. They saved enough money to move out of Victor’s mother-in-law’s house, which was putting pressure on everyone. Their new home was made of cane and they slept on the floor. Now, after working hard, they enjoy a house that is made of concrete, and each child has a room of his own. The Riveras are proud to have gotten out of their previouos situation, which was dire poverty. Although they are still poor, they enjoy a standard of living that most do not have in Ecuador. Their wish is to continue growing the business and open a store located next to their house. \r\n;;Victor needs this loan so that he can increase the volume of shoes and clothing  in stock to sell when the Riveras go to market.  ;EC;Ecuador;Guayaquil;standard;;7;9;12;;Victor;male;true;monthly;field_partner

3499;Komi;Mr. Komi A. was born on July 15, 1967 to a poor family in Lomé. Not having enough money to go far away for his studies, he decided to learn carpentry and thus receive profesionnal training. Now married and the father of three (03) children, he has his own workshop. He is dynamic and innovative, and attracts clients by displaying his products outside.

To do this, he is asking for a $1500 credit that will enable him to buy two machines that can handle all the necessary carpentry work.

4498;Fonima;Fonima is a very shy widow but is one of the more active savers in the SPBD programme. She joined the Centre at Tulaele in 2005. Since the husband died in 2003, she started thinking about ways of surviving with her two children and a grandmother. She got in, and her first Loan was 300 tala (US$ 120). This loan was used for purchase of  stocks for her small shop. With the second loan of  500 tala (US$ 200), she also spent it on more stocks.\r\n\r\nFonima paid off her loan promptly and was therefore entitled to get  1,250 tala (US$ 500)  on her next loan. Fonima already  spent the other two loans on the stock, and with this loan she thought of renovating her small shop, so she used it to double wall the inside of the store. Fonima is excited that these loans enable her family to go on and live since her husband died.\r\n\r\nAt the end of last year, Fonima paid off her loan and got another loan amounting to 1,750 tala (US$ 700). This loan also was used to further improve her store. As we have seen in the photo taken, the store looks new and it’s just after the work done last week.\r\n\r\nApart from the Loans, on the other side, Fonima is one of the ladies that have a vision.

At project’s end in 1996 I returned to the sale of everyday goods at the local market. In 1998 I rented a small commercial establishment belonging to my brother, and to this day I continue to work there. At this time my husband and I and 4 other employees depend on this business. With the loan I intend to acquire a vehicle to transport diverse cargo to my commercial establishment. This would facilitate our contribution to the increased rent and to the availability of diverse products at accessible prices to more than 100 families residing in the town of Salamanga. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.</b><p>Catarina C. de 39 anos de idade, Natural de Salamanga, distrito de Matutuíne Província de Maputo, Casada Maritalmente, Mãe de 4 filhos, tendo sido escolarizada até 6ª classe, Não conseguiu continuar mais com os estudos devido a  guerra  civil dos 16 que afectou severamente o distrito de Matutuíne.\r\n\r\nDurante a guerra os pais refugiaram-se na vizinha África do Sul em  1985, Por lá começou a trabalhar numa Carpintaria com a Função de marceneira,  por um período de Dois Anos e mais tarde veio a trabalhar como empregada Domestica em duas residenciais.  \r\n\r\nEm 1989 Casou-se Maritalmente na Africa do sul com um jovem moçambicano, que na altura se encontrava a trabalhar naquele pais vizinho. \r\n\r\nCom o fim da Guerra em 1992 decidem com o marido voltar a Moçambique em 1994,  Tendo  fixado a família na cidade do Maputo e lá dedicava-se a venda de produtos diversos na sua residência, segundo ela, não foram felizes com a realidade urbana assim viram-se obrigados em 1995 a voltar para Salamanga no distrito de Matutuíne, zona de origem. \r\n\r\nAinda no mesmo ano começou a trabalhar num projecto de reasentamento dos regressados dos países vizinhos como facilitadora dos cursos de corte e costura.

He is not married nor does he have children, but he is still very close to his parents as they live together and work the lands.  He also works at the local rice processing center.  </p>\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank</h4> \r\n<p> Eliceo is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </em></p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  </p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit</h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  </p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use</h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n</p> \r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. </p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </em></p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba</h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. </p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. </p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. </p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit</h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. </p> \r\n<h4>Risks</h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province “Los Rios” (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. </p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use</h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p>\r\n;;Rice Farming;EC;Ecuador;Baba;standard;;7;8;13;;Guido;male;true;monthly;field_partner

All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. They will use the microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. </em></p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia</h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. </p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  </p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia</h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo</i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  </p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit</h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  </p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use</h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. </p> \r\n;;To farm rice on her lands;EC;Ecuador;Santa Lucia;standard;;7;8;38;;Grey;female;true;monthly;field_partner

10047;Marcelino;<p>Marcelo is a rice farmer and cattle rancher in Salitre, Ecuador. He is hoping that with the loans he can begin preparing the lands in his farm for rice farming. He will work the lands and buy fertilizer for his crops. He lives with his two daughters, a son and his wife in a house near the home of his parents. His goal is to level the lands so that they will be more productive for years to come. He is pictured with our loan officer filling out his loan application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment</h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water basins that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. </i></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre</h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.</p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. </p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the freshwater Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.</p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit</h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to sell them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.</p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks</h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in a rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances, they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.</p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Niño occurs, the rice farmers  lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.</p>;;Level his lands for rice farming;EC;Ecuador;Salitre;standard;;7;8;25;;Marcelino;male;true;monthly;field_partner

He transfered to the city of Maputo where he continued his studies until the third year of Comercial school and obtained a house. In 2000 he sold his house and moved to the Bagamoyo village where he resides until this day. With the money from the sale of his house, he built another house and developed his water business. The architect's miscalculations of the structure caused the water tanks to collapse, and Albino lost his investment. Still, he continued with his project, and with the help of some friends, he was able to purchase a new water tank. He also came to know Hluvuku and asked him for a loan, increasing the number of tanks to two.

21356;I Komang Muriada;With only a Middle school diploma, and a so so looks, it was not enough for I Komang Muriada to get a job at a formal institution or a private company. Especially since married to Putu Putri Ariani, his responsibility has increased to provide a living for a wife and two children. Therefore Komang Muriada has to work hard to obtain enough income to support continued family living. Several work as laborer has been tried, however the income was not enough to support ever increasing family needs. Finally Komang Muriada follows his parents footsteps to work as a farmer. He works on the 40 are (about 4000 square meters) land owned by his parents with Dinari's loan. Komang Muriada started this new work since last year. As with othe farmers in his village, Komang Muriada also plants long bean vegetables on the land. From working the land, planting seeds, fertilized it, to spraying was done by Komang Muriada himself. During harvest time Komang Muriada is getting help from his wife and 2 daily laborers at a rate of Rp20,000 (about US$2.20)/day. In one plucking day harvest, Komang Muriada could make about 100 bunches (about 1 kg/bunch), which he sold for Rp2500-Rp3000 (about 30-35 cents). This was done once every two days. Long beans could be pluck about 25-30X per period (3 months).  Within a period Komang Muriada could produce about Rp 6,000,000 (about US$660) in income. After subtracting Expenses for fertilizers, pesticides, labor cost, etc his net profit is Rp2,050,000 (about US$220)/ 3 months. This makes Komang Muriada more enthusiastic in doing his work.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.</b><p>\r\nDengan hanya memiliki Ijazah SMP dan ketrampilan yang pas-pasan,  tak cukup bagi I Komang Muriada untuk mendapatkan pekerjaan di lembaga formal maupun perusahaan swasta.

Berbagai  pekerjaan sebagai buruh sudah di cobanya, namun hasilnya tak cukup untuk memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya yang semakin meningkat. Sehingga akhirnya Komang Muriada harus mengikuti jejak orang tuanya terjun sebagai petani . Menggarap tanah seluas 40 Are milik orang tua dan dengan  modal pinjaman dari Dinari, Komang Muriada memulai  menekuni pekerjaan barunya sejak tahun lalu . Seperti halnya petani lain di desanya Komang muriada juga menanami tanah garapannya dengan tanaman sayuran yaitu kacang panjang. Dari mengolah tanah,  menanam bibit , memupuk dan menyemprot di kerjakan Komang Muriada sendiri . Sedangkan pada waktu musim panen Komang Muriada di bantu oleh istri dan juga ada dua orang tenaga buruh yang di bayar harian sebesar Rp 20.000,-  .

23080;Nacoj Women Group;The women of Nacoj are very enterprising and dynamic.  What is more, they have an immense knowledge about Mayan crafts.  Many of them are specialists in the meaning of the designs and colors that the Mayans use in the traditional clothing of the Chimaltenango region. <p>\r\n\r\nSince they were children, all of the members of this group have cultivated the art of traditional weaving.  It is for this reason that they feel so confident about starting a business of traditional weaving, as they know the art like the palms of their hands.  In total, the group is requesting a loan of $2,631, each woman receiving between $132 and $263 in six installments.  This means that the women in the group will have the same business capacity, as the amount is similar for each. <p>\r\n\r\nThe majority of the women in the group work making, selling, and reselling traditional weavings such as <i> huipiles </i>\r\n(traditional clothing of indigenous Guatemalan women), <i> cortes </i> (traditional skirts), tablecloths and napkins.  Thus, they will use their loans to buy merchandise wholesale in order to resell it in the villages and markets of Chimaltenango, and to buy raw materials to weave their traditional products.  Nonetheless, Mrs. María Lucia E. Tu has a bicycle repair shop.  She is going to need her loan to buy spare parts.  María B. has a <i> tortillería </i> (store that sells tortillas) and she needs the money to continue buying corn to make tortillas. <p>\r\n\r\nThe dream of these craftswomen is to find a market for crafts abroad.  They would like to be able to export their beautiful and well-developed products abroad.  In addition, they have the desire to give a better future to their children.

Charcoal is cheap. It is not like the briquettes you buy in the store. It is made by felling trees, which are then chopped into pieces. A hole is dug in the earth and a smoldering fire is set. Banana leaves are placed over the hot coals, and the chopped pieces of timber are placed on the banana leaves. On top of the timber are placed more banana leaves. The entire pit is then buried lightly with loose dirt, enough that the coals can still breath. In three days the pit is opened, and the timbers have been charred all the way through, thus making charcoal. \r\n<p>\r\nA person selling charcoal will always be needed. If he can build a strong clientele, he can operate his business for a long time. He will buy charcoal in 100kg bags and sell by 2 cups.

Clothes made by a tailor are always cheaper than store-bought and is more compelling for buyers because they can take part in the design! <p>\r\n\r\nTailoring is also a skilled trade, so if you have a knack for it and produce good work, you will always be in need, unlike a produce stand that can be here today and gone tomorrow.

Once a girl drops out of school, she becomes economically vulnerable and her hopes and dreams fade away.

In addition to the income from each piglet produced by the sows, Murdani also earns some money from breeding her boars to the neigbors' sows. She earns 50,000 IDR (~5.30 USD) for each breeding.  Hence her income from the boars depends on the demand. Feeding the boars is not much different than that of the sows, except for additional supplements and formula to increase the boars stamina. Her profit is used to pay for her child's education at the Udayana University in Denpasar (in 3rd semester). Murdani hopes to use the loan to fix the hog pen.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.</b><p>\r\n\r\nSayu Putu Murdani seorang ibu rumah tangga yang tidak bisa tinggal diam.

This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

She thanks you for your support.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through sale and leaseback arrangements. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. Accordingly, most women in Tanzania receive poor financial support and, as such, have very little income to provide for their basic needs and services. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. In practice, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women; specifically, in a SELFINA sale and leaseback transaction, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client (to provide the client with cash flow) and then leases the equipment back to her so that she can continue to use the equipment.";;To purchase additional goods in bulk for her general store.;TZ;Tanzania;Dar es Salaam;standard;;90;15;5;;Mwajuma;female;true;monthly;field_partner

In the future, Anna plans to diversify her business. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. <P>;;To purchase additional chicks to raise and sell.;TZ;Tanzania;Dar es Salaam;standard;;90;13;10;;Anna;female;true;monthly;field_partner

44032;I Nengah Sedra;I Nengah Sedra is a diligent and tenacious farmer, who strives to meet his family’s needs. His wife does not work, and thus, he carries the burden alone through his farming income to meet his family’s needs. I Nengah Sedra works on a 1-hectare farm owned by his parents. His family’s daily expense is quite expensive especially since his children are still in school. His harvests are sometimes not maximized because his cultivation method and seeds are not the best. Better farming equipment, seeds and supporting materials require a larger capital, which he didn’t have. I Nengah Sedra is relieved that DINARI is helping him get a loan he needs to improve his farming. This loan will be used to buy superior seeds, organic fertilizers and pesticides. I Nengah Sedra rents a tractor to till his farm because he doesn’t have an ox to do the job. I Nengah Sedra is waiting for his next harvest, which he hopes to yield better results from his previous harvests. He will use his farming income to support his children’s educational needs, and if there is still some money left, he really hopes to fix his unfinished house.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Joan, Kiva volunteer.</b><p>\r\n\r\nI Nengah Sedra seorang petani yang sangat rajin dan ulet, semua dilakukan supaya ekonomi keluarga bisa tercukupi.

Sawah yang dikerjakan seluas 1 hektar dan itu pun masih menjadi milik orang tuanya. Biaya yang dikeluarkan setiap hari cukup besar apalagi anak-anaknya masih duduk dibangku sekolah. Sedangkan dari hasil panen yang diperoleh tidaklah maksimal karena dalam pengolahan tanah maupun pembibitan dan pemeliharaan tidak bisa dilakukan dengan maksimal,ini semua karena terbentur dengan modal.

Modal tersebut dipergunakan untuk membeli bibit unggul,pupuk organik dan juga obat pestisida. Pengolahan tanah dilakukan dengan menyewa traktor, karena I Nengah Sedra tidak mempunyai sapi untuk membajak.

54997;Sousa;"Sousa L. is 46 years old. He is married and he had 6 children. The oldest one is 26 and the others are 21, 13, 11, 8 and 1 year old respectively. The are all in school except for the youngest one. Besides his sons and daughters, he also supports his mother and nephews that live with her by sending money and food. \r\nSousa went to school until the 8th grade and because of his family situation he had to start working at an early age to cover the expenses, worse yet, there were no evening classes available at that time. Sousa worked for a pottery company in Mozambique that awarded him in 1981 with a 3-year scholarship in Cuba. He still receives pension payments from that company. He lives in his own home.\r\nIn 1989, Sousa built an iron shop that later had to be passed on to his ex-wife when they were divorced. Sousa is now self-employed. Since 1999 he has been running a restaurant he built with his own resources. The restaurant opens at 8:00am and closes at 9:00pm; it has 3 employees. He learned the skills needed on his own when he realized that his salary was not enough to pay for his family´s needs. The best selling dish is pork meat which goes for 80,00mt and costs him 45,00mt. His monthly income is 12000,00mt and from that amount he saves 3500,00mt.\r\nThis is his second loan request in his life and first through Kiva. The first loan was in the amount of 10000,00mt given by BPD (People´s Development Bank) and it was used to build the iron shop his ex-wife now owns. The second loan will be used to purchase a variety of products for the restaurant, thus, increasing sales. \r\nIn the future, with help from other loans, Sousa intends to open up a butcher´s shop to sell meat and expand his business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer</p> \r\n\r\nSousa L. tem 46 ano de idade, casado maritalmente e pai de 6 filhos sendo de 26 anos de idade o primeiro, 21 o segundo, 13 o terceiro, 11 o quarto, 8 o quinto e um ano o sexto.

Left by her husband several years ago, Estama has found herself in the same position as many women here in the Dominican and in her home country, Haiti.  She is left to provide for her two boys (ages 14, 16) with whatever means she can.  The money from this loan will go towards purchasing paint, sand paper, various tools, as well as several old beds that may be refurbished and sold.  She aspires to continue growing her business, so that someday she might be able to own her own shop that she can work out of.\r\n<p>\r\nEstama is one of the leaders of the 10 person micro bank Hermanas Unidas, which means ""United Sisters"". All ten women in the bank are Haitian immigrants who have come to earn a living in the Dominican informal sector. These unique entrepreneurs unite in solidarity, promising to cover one another if someone fails on a payment, thus allowing them to access funding that they would otherwise never be able to receive on their own.  The concept of this group bank paying their loan together is to reduce the risk of one person defaulting due to the strong peer pressure from their fellow bank members.  As these 10 women embark upon their firS.ever loan from Esperanza, we are confident that they will all succeed in bettering their lives and the lives of their families with this loan. Their businesses are simple, but offer a stream of income that could never have been accomplished without such a loan for initial capital.

Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. What are kuku, you may ask? Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular because they require little startup capital, require little space, and their eggs can be sold or eaten. Saida is assisted in her poultry business by one employee, her husband, and her children. Her monthly profit is approximately 120 USD. She is seeking a 275 USD loan to purchase additional chicks and feed that she hopes will help her breed more chickens for sale.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.";;To buy additional chicks and feed;TZ;Tanzania;Dar es Salaam;standard;;90;12;6;;Saida;female;true;monthly;field_partner

This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services.

Elle vit dans le 3ème quartier de Ségou (quatrième région économique de la république du Mali) avec son mari et son enfant.\r\nDès son jeune âge elle s’essaya à plusieurs activités génératrices de revenus sans succès .Elle finit par approcher et apprendre auprès de sa grand-mère (qui est une spécialiste réputée d’une science traditionnelle à savoir la fabrication de Gongonlili et d’encense qui sont des produits aphrodisiaques traditionnels). Après sa phase d’apprentissage, depuis maintenant 15 ans, elle exerce cette activité (relevant des connaissances sécrètes). Madame Kadiatou C. jouit aujourd’hui d’une notoriété d’envergure sous régionale. Elle reçoit des commandes de toute la sous région de l’Afrique de l’ouest (Mali, Burkina et Cote d’Ivoire). Pour avoir ces produits aphrodisiaques, il faut amener une nouvelle calebasse qu’on remplit d’eau propre et qui sera versée sur le gongonlili (plante exotique très prisée en Afrique de l’ouest pour avoir des vertus aphrodisiaques et médicales). Elle donnera à ce gongonlili totalement imbibé une forme circulaire ou ovale après l’avoir attaché d’un fil blanc.). Cette plante est soit bouillie dans de l’eau chaude et la décoction en liquide est consommée. \r\n\r\nPour satisfaire sa clientèle de plus en plus importante, elle décida de rejoindre l’institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso depuis maintenant 3 ans. Après 4 prêts solidaires, elle est à son deuxième prêt individuel et tous les prêts précédents ont été correctement remboursés. Elle compte acheter avec ce prêt : 50 sacs de gongonlili, 20 kg d’encense, 2 cartons de parfums, 2 rouleaux de fil local et des bouteilles vides de mayonnaise. Elle s’approvisionne en matières premières essentiellement à partir de Bamako (capitale de république du Mali) et San (région de Ségou). Très connue pour détenir cette science, elle réalise d’énormes ventes au comptant souvent en gros à une clientèle variée. Elle espère réaliser un bénéfice de 200 000 FCFA et rêve ardemment de construire une maison.;Mrs. Kadiatou C. is 47 years old, is married and a mother of one child. She lives in the 3rd district of Ségou (fourth economic region of the Republic of Mali) with her husband and child. At a young age. she tried herself out at several businesses but without success. She ended up approaching and learning from her grandmother (who is a famous traditional science specialist) to learn the production of Gongonlili and incense, traditional aphrodisiac products. After completing her training, she continued to work in this area concerning secret knowledge. Today, Mrs. Kadiatou C. enjoys a great reputation in her region. She receives orders from all areas of West Africa (Mali, Burkina and Ivory Coast). To produce these aphrodisiac products, a new water bottle needs to be filled with clean water that is poured on the gongonlili (exotic plant in West Africa believed to have aphrodisiac and medical properties). She then shapes the completely soaked gongonlili into a circular or oval form after having attached it to a white wire. This plant is then boiled in hot water and the liquid concoction is then consumed.  She decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution 3 years ago in order to satisfy the needs of her growing clientele. After 4 group loans, this is her second individual loan, with all preceding loans refunded in full. With this loan, she intends to buy: 50 bags of gongonlili, 20 kg of incense, 2 boxes of perfume, 2 rolls of local wire and empty mayonnaise jars. She gets her raw materials primarily from Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali) and San (Ségou region). Very well known in this science, she generates enormous cash sales, often in wholesale, with various customers.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Still, she can only save trace amounts of her income as very little is left after paying school fees and living expenses.  \r\n\r\nHanifa hopes to buy her own fishing nets and employ local boys to fish exclusively for her.

78686;I Ketut Sada;I Ketut Sada memiliki lahan seluas 1 hektar. Seluruh lahan yang dimilikinya ditanami dengan padi, karena pengairan yang cukup memadai sepanjang tahun. Selama 1 tahun, tanaman padi bisa dipanen sebanyak 3 kali. Sebelumnya, I Ketut Sada menanam padi dengan bibit jenis lokal karena harganya yang lebih murah. Namun, keuntungan yang didapatnya tidak maksimal, karena bibit jenis lokal mudah terserang penyakit. Dalam satu kali panen ( 4 bulan ), ia hanya mendapat keuntungan sebesar Rp. 500.000.- setelah dikurangi semua biaya untuk pengolahan tanah dan perawatan tanaman. Hal itu dirasakan belum mencukupi kebutuhan keluarganya, apalagi dengan kondisi ekonomi saat ini. Karena ingin meningkatkan taraf hidupnya dan keluarganya, I Ketut Sada mengajukan pinjaman ke Yayasan Dinari sebesar Rp. 6.000.000.- Pinjaman tersebut dipergunakan untuk membeli bibit padi kwalitas unggul sebesar Rp. 3.000.000.-, biaya pengolahan tanah dengan menyewa pekerja sebesar Rp. 1.000.000.- dan membeli pupuk serta anti hama sebesar Rp. 2.000.000.- I Ketut Sada sudah belajar dengan petani yang sudah lebih dulu menggunakan bibit kwalitas unggul sehingga ia tidak ragu untuk mendapat pinjaman, karena sesuai dengan kenyataan, bibit padi kwalitas unggul mampu menghasilkan hingga 3 kali lipat dibanding dengan bibit jenis lokal. Satu kali panen, bibit unggul bisa mendapatkan keuntungan sebesar Rp. 1.500.000.- hingga Rp. 2.000.000.- Dengan terus didampingi oleh staf Dinari dan petani padi yang telah sukses dengan bibit padi kwalitas unggul, I Ketut Sada optimis yakin usahanya akan sukses.\n\n\n;I Ketut Sada owns a land of 1 hectare (around 2.5 acres). Due to his land does not have a proper irrigation system, he uses his whole land for paddy farming. He can harvests his paddy farming 3 times a year. He used local paddy seeds in the past because they were cheaper. However he was not able to get a good result out of it. In one harvest season (around 4 month period) he can only get a profit of IDR 500 thousand (around USD 45). That was certainly not enough to make a living especially in this current economic condition.<p>\r\nHe applied for a loan from Dinari foundation for an amount of IDR 6 million (around USD 550).

78864;Kiko;"Kiko, joven trabajador de 24 años de edad, vive  en la casa de su madre en compañía de su hermano menor. Los padres de Kiko fueron agricultores, sembraban papa en grandes cantidades, pero hubo un mal tiempo donde ellos se quedaron sin capital, desde entonces, hace 5 años Kiko trabaja en las chacras de sus vecinos, le pagaban diario 15 soles, incluido almuerzo.  Y hace como 2 años que empezó a sembrar su propia chacra, donde tiene cultivado dos hectáreas de papa, y otro poco de arvejas, cuando cosecha los lleva al mercados y eso le causa mucha satisfacción. Tiene anhelos de progresar sembrando en grandes cantidades, debido al buen precio que se está cotizando actualmente en el mercado;  pero a la vez le es imposible por la falta dinero, ya que los fertilizantes son muy costosos. Esta es la séptima vez que viene trabajando Kiko con un préstamo de MFP, pagando sus cuotas en las fechas fijadas, sin mora alguna. El dinero que le facilitarán, es para la compra del fertilizante llamado “Alimuful” que sirve para el desarrollo de la papa.\n";"Kiko, a young worker of 24 years old, lives in the house of his mother and in the company of his younger brother.  Kiko\'s parents were farmers.  They grew potatoes in large quantities, but had a bad season where they were left without money.  After that, starting five years ago Kiko worked in the farms of his neighbors.  They paid him 15 Soles daily, including lunch.  And about 2 years ago he began to farm his own plot of land, where he is cultivating two hectares of potatoes and another little bit of peas.  When he harvests, he takes them to the markets and this gives him much satisfaction.  He longs to continue growing large quantities, owing to the good prices that he is receiving nowadays in the market; but at the same time it is impossible because of a lack of money, since the fertilizers are very costly.  This is the seventh time that Kiko comes working with a loan from MFP (Microfinanzas PRISMA, a Kiva field partner), making his payments on the set dates without a single late payment.  The money that they will give him is to buy the fertilizer called ""Alimuful"", which helps in the growth of the potatoes.  <br /><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Megan Tatman Montgomery, Kiva Volunteer</strong></p>";To buy fertilizers for his crops;PE;Peru;TARMA;standard;;71;10;17;;Kiko;male;true;bullet;field_partner

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n;;To buy more materials for making clothes to sell.;TZ;Tanzania;Mwanza;standard;;90;12;14;;Justina;female;true;monthly;field_partner

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

84373;Mariam;"Mambo from Tanzania! This is 30-year-old Mariam W. from Mwanza. She is married with two children, 7 and 11 years old. Mariam has been running a poultry (""kuku"") business. Raising ""kuku"" is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst our borrowers. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. <P>\r\n\r\nMariam has been in this business since 2000 and her business is doing well. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week, and is assisted by one employee. Mariam W. currently earns about US$ 250 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of US$ 400 in order to continue with her poultry business.  Mariam thanks you for her support!<P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.<P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n";;To buy 200 chicks;TZ;Tanzania;Mwanza;standard;;90;12;13;;Mariam;female;true;monthly;field_partner

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The Christian Reform Church Primary School Kabala was founded by Mr. Dennis De Groot and the school started its operations on the 26th of September 2007. At the end of the war, the school was set up with a desire to give quality education to the children of Koinadugu District and to rebuild good moral attitudes in the minds of the children by diligently teaching them the word of God. The school currently has 147 pupils with a staff of seven.<p>\r\n\r\nThe school is still a new one with only classes one to five. Come next year, they will get their first group of pupils to write the National Primary School Examination (BECE). Only two years since its inception now, the school has gained a reputation for quality education. It is the only school in Kabala with a ratio of thirty pupils to one teacher. It has a very good resource center for both teachers and pupils. They encourage teachers from other schools to use their resource center. By comparison, their resource center is far more equipped than many secondary schools in the town (i.e. for the few schools that have a library). It is also the only primary school in Kabala that provides cooked rice to its pupils. Other primary schools either do not have this facility or manage to provide for their pupils with bulgur wheat supplied by the UNHCR. <p>\r\n\r\nThis school is not a government-assisted school like the other schools in town; hence, it gets all these opportunities that are lacking in other primary schools. Its teachers receive their salaries from Frasirvalley Christian High School in Canada, and their salaries are said to be far better than government-sponsored schools. (Learn more about this school at http://kabalaschoolproject.blogspot.com).<p>\r\n\r\nThe Christian Reform Church Primary School Kabala suffers from a few constraints. The school is situated far away from the town center, making it strenuous for both pupils and staff to come to school everyday. The continuing rise in the cost of food stuffs is also affecting the running of the school, and in addition to these, the school currently lacks enough drugs to give first aid to the children.<p>\r\n\r\nJames T.

92398;Raúl;Raúl tiene 40 años de edad, está casado hace 16 años, siendo padre de 7 hijos, de los cuales 5 viven en su casa. La agricultura es parte de las buenas costumbres que le heredaron sus padres, en todo este tiempo ha tratado de sembrar mayor cantidad arvejas y habas, aunque éstas en menor cantidad por ser de menor ganancia. Raúl procura alquilar chacras donde ya hayan crecido papas anteriormente, esto facilita la siembra de arvejas, ya que de un saco de granos de arvejas, llega a cosechar de 50 a 60 sacos, esto lo realiza 3 veces como máximo en la misma chacra. Pero no todo es bueno, ya que Raúl en ciertas oportunidades se ve amenazado por las plagas que se implantan en las chacras por la excesiva lluvia, y tambien la helada (clima helado), sabiendo que si la rancha ataca a sus cultivos, se puede contrarrestar con funguicidas y pesticidas, pero con la helada no hay solución alguna para salvar los cultivos. Raúl está muy feliz con sus cultivos de arvejas, pese a las dificultades que tiene, los precios lo alientan a seguir sembrando, ya que son muy rentables para él. Él es secretario de su banco comunal, en cada una de las reuniones está encargado de redactar todos los acuerdos, este es su 2do préstamo con MFP, y en todo este tiempo viene pagando puntualmente sus cuotas. El dinero que solicita es para la compra de fertilizantes para sembrar nuevamente arvejas y con la venta de ellas comprar semillas. Raúl nos comenta su alegría por habérsele otorgado el crédito, lo que le permite seguir trabajando.;"Raúl is 40 years old, married for 16 years, and is the father of 7 children, 5 of whom are still at home. Farming is part of the good habits he inherited from his parents, he has always tried to grow a large quantity of peas and beans, even though these in smaller quantity products smaller profits. Raúl was able to rent farms where they previously grew potatoes, and this facilitated growing peas, as from one sack of pea seeds he can harvest 50-60 sacks, and this he does at the most 3 times on the same farmland. But not all is well, as Raúl has been threatened by various plagues on his fields because of excessive rain, and also frost (in this cold climate), knowing that if a pestilence attacks his crops, he can use fungicides and pesticides, but with the frost there isn’t a way to save his crops. Raúl is very happy with his pea crops, despite the difficulties that he has, the prices support him continuing to grow this crop as they are very profitable for him. He is secretary of his communal bank; at each of the meetings he is in charge of recording all the agreements. This is his 2nd loan with MFP, and all this time he has been punctual with his payments. The money he seeks is to buy fertilizer for his next pea planting and with the sales of his peas buy seeds.

It was the home of famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sin embargo, es muy cansado tener que trabajar durante el día enseñando y salir por las tarde a distribuir sus pedidos de zapatos y a realizar sus cobranzas hasta muy noche. Por estos motivos desea alquilar un stand donde pueda atender su negocio en las tardes sin tener que caminar mucho por las calles y dedicarse a buscar nuevos modelos de zapatos que llamen la atención de las personas.

She is married and has a son that she lives with in their own house. She is a teacher at a private school, but in order to cover all of her expenses, she began a shoe sales business 8 years ago. She buys the shoes in downtown Lima in order to sell them in her neighborhood to her neighbors and friends. She sells the shoes on credit, allowing her customers to pay for them little by little, which makes it a profitable business, as the final price is higher, because it includes the fees charged for making monthly payments.<p>\r\nHowever, she is very tired of having to teach during the day and then go out in the evenings to deliver shoe orders and collect her payments until late at night. For this reason, she would like to rent a stand where she can run her business in the afternoons without having to walk so much around the neighborhood, and can focus on looking for new shoe designs that will interest people. Monica has been an MFP client for 5 years and this is her 8th loan.

95940;Basilia;Basilia es una mujer muy tranquila y trabajadora, a sus 36 años a logrado formar una familia y ser  el principal sustento de ella, vive en una casa alquilada y no pierde las esperanzas de mejorar su situación económica. Rodeada de sus queridos animales Basilia pasa sus días, ella trabaja muy duro para que su ganado se alimente bien y crezca sano, para luego llevarlo a la feria dominical y venderlos en espera de sacar un buen precio por sus animalitos y casi siempre lo consigue, ya que son los más grandes de la feria. Lo que más le gusta a Basilia de su trabajo, es que puede pasar sus días en el campo que tanto quiere y respirar su aire limpio, son ya 10 años, los que lleva en este negocio y piensa continuar el tiempo que sea necesario, con tal de darle una mejor vida a su familia. Lo que menos le gusta de su trabajo es perseguir a los corderitos que a veces se escapan y corren muy lejos del resto del ganado. Basilia anhela poner un negocio propio, tal vez una tienda de abarrotes o un restaurante, todavía no se decide, pero sabe que tiene que trabajar duro para mejorar la vida que actualmente tiene su familia. Es su primer préstamo con MFP y se siente en la responsabilidad de pagarlo a tiempo para poder acceder a otro, en su banco comunal es muy activa y siempre participa de todas las decisiones que se toman. Con el dinero solicitado comprará más ganado, para mejorar sus ingresos, también comprará forraje para alimentar a sus animales en la temporada de heladas (frío intenso) que se avecina.;"Basilia is a very peaceful and hardworking woman. At 36 years of age, she has formed a family and is its primary breadwinner. She lives in a rented house and has not lost hope of improving her economic situation. She passes the days surrounded by her beloved animals. She works very hard to ensure that her livestock eat well and grow up healthy, then takes them to the Sunday market and sells them in hopes of getting a good price for her animals, and she nearly always does since hers are the largest in the market. What she loves most about her work is that she can spend her days in the country she loves so much, breathing clean air. She has spent 10 years in this business and plans to continue doing so as long as it takes to give her family a better life. What she likes the least about her work is chasing after lambs that escape and run very far from the herd. Basilia wishes to have her own business, perhaps a grocery store or a restaurant; she still hasn't decided, but she knows that she has to work hard to improve her family's lives. This is her first loan with MFP, and she understands her responsibility to make repayments on time in order to access more loans. She is very active in her communal bank and always participates in their decisions. With this loan, she will buy more livestock to improve her income, and will also buy forage to feed her animals during the seasonal frost (intense cold) that lies ahead.<br /><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer</strong></p>";Increase livestock and buy food for the animals;PE;Peru;Juliaca;standard;;71;8;11;;Basilia;female;true;monthly;field_partner
96066;Wofunira Development Association (B) Group; Ruth has had her poultry business for about 5 years now.  She has 400 broiler chickens that she raises.  People come to her home and buy these chickens to take to the market to sell.    Ruth says that the market for broiler chickens is very large so it is able to support the large number of people who do it. Ruth buys her chickens from Uga-chick.  Uga-chick is a place where many Ugandan poultry farmers buy day-old chickens.  Although this practice does not differentiate her from other poultry farmers, she tries to be competitive in the market by spending extra money on food supplements.  The important thing with broiler chickens is that they are heavy.  If you just feed the chickens a lot of food, they will grow heavy, but not as heavy as if you spend a little extra for supplements.    Ruth has four older children who stay around her home.  She says that although they are now old (32, 30, 28, and 25), they still depend on her.  She also has 3 small children that she cares for.  Two of these children are from her late brother and one of them is a grandchild.  These children all need their daily needs met as well as school fees.    Ruth is requesting a loan of 250,000 USH.  This will allow her to buy the critical supplements as well as four bags of feed.  ;;Food for her chickens as well as supplements to make them fat.;UG;Uganda;Zana;standard;;84;6;70;;Ruth, Margaret, Patrica, Prossu, Barabara, Annett, Suzane, Phoeb;female, female, female, female, female, female, female, female;true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true;monthly;field_partner

The country is home to communities still speaking the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization dating back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R and further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Años atrás solo sembraba en chacras temporales (regadas por la lluvia), y sus cosechas eran en los meses abril a mayo. Pero quiso cambiar esa realidad alquilando chacras de regadío y cambiado todas las semillas de acuerdo al tipo de tierra. Han pasado más de tres años y por fin está viendo los frutos de su esfuerzo. Ahora sus cosechas son  cada dos o tres veces por año, y cree haber aprendido las técnicas para convertirse en un gran agricultor. Sus metas próximas son de sembrar en la costa, debido a que cuenta con una buena cantidad de semillas especiales para ese clima, así incrementará su producción, con ello sus ganancias y convertirá su labor en una actividad muy rentable. Hace un año Nazario fue el presidente de su banco comunal, y cumplió muy bien con sus funciones, este es su 8vo préstamo con MFP, en todo este tiempo demostró responsabilidad en sus pagos.

His other siblings all left for Lima to look for a better future, and have proposed that he go with them, but he prefers to stay and work the land, as he refers to agriculture, since he really likes this activity.  Many years ago he only farmed small plots of land (watered by the rain), and his harvests were in the months of April and May.  But he wanted a change from renting land and changed all the seeds according to the type of land.  More than three years have passed and he is finally seeing the fruit of his labor.  Now his crops are harvested two or three times a year, and he believes he has learned the techniques to become a great farmer.  His upcoming goals are to farm on the coast, since he has a large quantity of seeds especially for  that climate.  In this way he will increase his production which will increase his earnings and make his work a very profitable activity.  Last year Nazario was the president of his community bank, and he completed all his tasks very well.  This is his eighth loan with MFP and in all this time he has shown responsibility in his payments.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n;;To purchase more medicine to resell to customers.;TZ;Tanzania;Mwanza;standard;;90;7;15;;Dina;female;true;monthly;field_partner

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n";;To purchase more materials in bulk for making clothing;TZ;Tanzania;Mbeya;standard;;90;8;30;;Tatu J.;female;true;monthly;field_partner

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

107162;Mirzoali;Mirzoali H.'s economic activity is agriculture, which he has dedicated himself to for several years. He is married and the father of 4 children. Mirzoali learned farming business from a young age and now has a lot of experience. It is very important to point out that his business requires a lot of effort, which is why he dedicates himself to growing potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. This requires a lot of exposure to the sun as well as moving the product long distances. The reason why Mirzoali is requesting a loan from IMON International is to invest in technological assistance in cultivation. With this loan he will be able to succeed and have better opportunities for the sale of his products after the harvest. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

En plus du poisson certaines d’entre elles font parfois le commerce d’oignon et de bois de chauffe à domicile.\nAfin d’augmenter le volume de leurs activités génératrices de revenus, elles décidèrent d’intégrer le programme de crédit de Soro Yiriwaso. Après avoir remboursé correctement leurs trois premiers prêts solidaires, elles sont à leur 4ème  qui sera utilisé pour acheter, 60 corbeilles correspondant à 900 kg de poisson frais. \nElles se ravitaillent en poisson sur les berges du fleuve Niger à Kirango. Une partie du poisson est séchée dans un coin de la maison à l’aide d’un séchoir traditionnel et l’autre moitié est vendue à l’état crue. Le poisson ainsi séché est revendu au comptant et en détail dans les foires de Konobougou, Sansanding et Siribala à une clientèle composée majoritairement de femmes. \nElles  envisagent réaliser chacune un bénéfice mensuel moyen de 51 000FCFA  qui sera utilisé  pour le remboursement du prêt et pour l’épargne. \nElles ont pour ambition d’avoir chacune un congélateur pour pouvoir conserver le poisson pendant les périodes de mévente. \n;This Djiguifa group is made up of nine married women, mostly from monogamous families, with an average age of 33 and 4 children, on average.

Это позволяло получить большую прибыль, так как разделение по сортам улучшало качество сухофруктов. Постепенно стал также заниматься куплей продажей корма для скота. Для этого он приобрел маленький грузовичок, на котором ездит за кормом в соседний Кыргызстан. На сегодня оборот его бизнеса вырос и позволяет содержать не только его семью, но и семью его родителей. С МикроИнвест Хоринчон сотрудничает уже больше года. Он и дальше планирует расширять свой бизнес, и поэтому решил подать новую заявку на займ.\n;Horinchon recently turned 30 years old.  He is married but does not have children yet.  He lives with his parents.  After finishing school Horinchon right away became a small entrepreneur.  He started by purchasing and selling dried fruits at the local markets.  Gradually after earning his own capital he started purchasing dried fruits in wholesale quantities and sorting them at home.  This allowed him to earn big profits, because sorting by grade improves the quality of dried fruits.  \r\n\r\nGradually he also started to purchase and sell animal feed.  He purchased a small truck for this on which he travels to neighboring Kirgizstan for feed.  By this point his turnover has grown and allows him to support not only his own family but also his parent’s family.  Horinchon has been working with MicroInvest for over a year.

Y desde hace 7 años ha ganado experiencia en realizar esta actividad, ya que para Rosa, el secreto es visitar a varias personas y salir diariamente a ofrecerles productos novedosos a través de catálogos y distribuirlos en las fechas indicadas para tener contenta a su clientela. Ahora tiene la ambición de ser empresaria, pues en las líneas de belleza motivan a las mujeres a no ser sólo promotoras, sino a buscar un equipo a las cuales puedas liderar y capacitar en las ventas, pero sin descuidar sus propios pedidos, por lo que le gustaría tener una tienda para la venta de estos productos. Rosa viene trabajando con MFP, desde hace 6 años, este es su catorceavo crédito, y durante esta temporada ha visto progresar a su grupo, pues tratan de organizarse adecuadamente para evitar circunstancias difíciles. Los 1500 soles que solicita los usará en la compra de productos para las fechas festivas que se aproximan, como el día de las madres.;For Rosa, the well-being of her loved ones is the most important thing, and so in her home they try to always remain supportive of one another.  This is an example she wants to leave her children for when they form their own homes.  Ever since she was a young girl, she has liked to care for her appearance and use makeup, and due to the high cost of buying cosmetics, she decided to become a cosmetics salesperson in her area.  For the past 7 years she has gained experience in this activity.  Rosa's secret is to visit many people and go out every day to offer them the newest products by means of catalogs, and then deliver the products by the deadline in order to keep her clients happy.   Now she has the ambition to be a business woman, since the beauty products business encourages the women to not only be product promoters, but to look for a team they can lead and equip in sales, but without neglecting their own customers' orders.  For this reason she would like to have a store to sell these products.  Rosa has been working with MFP for 6 years, this is her fourteenth loan, and during this period she has seen her group progress, since they try to organize themselves in order to avoid difficult circumstances.  She will use the 1,500 soles she is requesting to buy products for the approaching holidays, like Mothers' Day.\r\n<br /><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer</strong></p>;To increase merchandise;PE;Peru;Lima;standard;;71;8;18;;Rosa;female;true;monthly;field_partner

Para más adelante, Antonia desea seguir trabajando en esta actividad pero comprando mayores cantidades.

Her buyers are the many small factories that make bricks in her area.  They use it for fuel in their condensation ovens.  During the rainy season, there is not as much demand, which is why it’s important to have a warehouse.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Cuando terminó la construcción de ésta pensó en instalar un negocio, comenzó vendiendo bebidas durante el verano, pero con el tiempo las personas demandaban muchas cosas más, lo cual fue el inicio de su bodega. Esta actividad la viene realizando hace 5 años trabajando desde las 6 de la mañana aseando su local, arreglando sus productos y preparándose para atender a sus clientes con una gran sonrisa, pues más importante que vender en demasía es brindar una atención adecuada a sus clientes ya que esa actitud garantizará el desarrollo y rentabilidad de su negocio, nos dice. Para un futuro cercano, Lucia quiere ampliar su tienda acondicionando un espacio adicional en su casa.

That is why they built their own house, where they are now living comfortably.  When they finished constructing their home Lucia thought about setting up a business.  She began by selling beverages during the summer, but soon her customers were asking for many more items.  This led to Lucia establishing her grocery store.  She has been involved in this activity for 5 years.  She begins work at 6 in the morning by tidying up the store, arranging her products, and getting ready to attend to her customers with a big smile.  Lucia tells us that one of the secrets to selling a lot of products is to provide suitable attention to her customers, and having that attitude will guarantee her business’s development and profitability.  In the near future Lucia wants to expand her store, setting up an additional space in her home.

Antes de este accidente trabajaba diariamente en las chacras de sus padres y de suegros; últimamente, con su esposo, decidieron sembrar papas y arvejas dejando a sus pequeñas al cuidado de su madre. A ella le gusta mucho el labrado de la tierra ya que lo  realizó desde muy pequeña y ahora que está descansando por sus dolencias se aburre mucho en su casa. Desde entonces, su esposo solo viene trabajando en los cultivos y ella espera  pronto poder recuperarse para realizar las cosechas, ya que es la época más trabajosa, pero una vez pasada esa temporada siente tranquilidad hasta la próxima siembra.

After suffering a terrible accident 20 days ago, Alicia was left with injuries to her body and face, which is why she covers her face with a scarf to block out the sun and stave off worse infections. Before the accident, she worked daily on the fields of her parents and in-laws. Ultimately, she and her husband decided to plant potatoes and peas of their own while they left their daughter in the care of Alicia's mother. Alicia really enjoys working on the land because it's something she has done since she was very little, and now that she is recovering from her ailments at home she is very bored. Since then, her husband has been the only one working on the crops, and she hopes she'll be able to get better soon so she can help with the harvest since that's when the most work is required, but once it passes everything relaxes until the next planting. Her wish for the future is to be able to acquire her own land to cultivate.

123362;CERATURO IRQUIS (CUENCA) Group;El Banco Comunal Ceraturo es un grupo nuevo de 17 socias y socios que son residentes del barrio Ceraturo Irquis en Victoria del Portete ubicado al sur de la  ciudad de Cuenca, este sector es de un clima demasiado frío y que por la tarde baja la neblina  lo que hace que la gente no transite por las calles ni salgan de sus casas.\n\nLa socia María Tránsito P. vive ya unos tres meses en casa de su cuñada que reside en el extranjero. María tiene 23 años de edad, es casada y tiene cinco hijos de 9, 7, 5, 3 años y la última de un mes de edad, los tres primeros hijos los cuales son varones están estudiando en la escuela de Ceraturo. Antes de ser socia de la Fundación trabajaba conjuntamente con su esposo en una hacienda la  Victoria del Portete  como peones, sacando leche de las vacas, en labores del campo, su horario era de 6 AM. A 6 PM. En esta hacienda los jefes eran algunos buenos y otros malos, pero lo que no le gustaba a María era que no los consideraban ya que debían ser cumplidos con su trabajo que no había ningún justificativo para faltar, no les importaba hijos ni enfermedades. Es socia más o menos desde el 16 de Junio de este año, un vecino del barrio les hizo conocer de la fundación y les invitó a que ingresen, pidió $110 de préstamo para comprar cuyes y hierba, para de esta manera salir de la hacienda en donde ella trabaja porque el tiempo no le alcanza para cuidar a sus hijos. Su meta es poder trabajar en la crianza de animales no solo de cuyes sino también de vacas, puercos y pollos para así progresar y poderles dar lo que ellos necesiten.\n\nLa socia Rosalía C. tiene 36 años, es casada, y tiene una hija de 16 años. Su esposo trabaja en latonería, reparando y pintando los carros, mientras ella trabaja como empleada doméstica y además vende productos cosméticas de Avon y de otras marcas también. Sus clientes son principalmente sus vecinas, amigas y conocidas. Hace 8 años que vende cosméticos, y desde niña está trabajando en los trabajos que le surgen, como empleada o en restaurantes. Ella también se encarga de los quehaceres domésticos de su propia casa. Suele trabajar desde las 7:30am hasta las 5pm. Está pidiendo este crédito de $220 para comprar productos de Avon, porque vende a crédito. Aveces la empresa hace promociones, entonces para ella le conviene cubrir los costos en estos momentos y recuperarlos después. Ella toma pedidos de sus clientes para cada quincena, y suele recibir $100-$120 en pedidos cada quincena, de los cuales un 25% es ganancia para ella (la ganancia se desminuye entre 5% y 10% después de tomar en cuenta sus costos). Este es la primera vez que ella ha sacado un préstamo. Para el futuro, le gustaría poner un negocio propio, por ejemplo un restaurante, porque le gusta mucho cocinar. \n\nTodos los socios y las socias están comprometidos a pagar el crédito puntualmente y de una manera responsable. \n;The Ceraturo Communal Bank is a group of 17 women and men who are residents of the Ceraturo Irquis neighborhood of Victoria del Portete, located to the south of the city of Cuenca.  This region experiences extreme cold while fog develops in the afternoons, making it difficult for people to travel through the streets and preventing them from leaving their homes.\r\n<p>\r\nMember María Tránsito P., for the past 3 months, has been living in the house of her sister-in-law who currently resides abroad.   María is 23 years old, married, and has 5 children (ages 9, 7, 5, 3 and 1 month).  Three of the children attend school in Ceraturo.  Before joining Fundación ESPOIR, she and her husband worked on the Victoria del Portete Estate as farm laborers.  They milked the cows and worked in the fields.  Their work schedule was from 6am to 6pm.  At the estate, some of the supervisors were good and while others were bad.  However, none of them liked it whenever María had to miss work or leave early to take care of her children whenever they became sick.  She became a member around June 16th of this year when a neighbor told her about the Foundation and invited her to join.  She is requesting a loan of $110 so that she can buy guinea pigs and grass, enabling her to quit her farm job so that she can spend more time caring for her children.  Her goal is to start breeding more animals, not just guinea pigs, but also cows, pigs and chickens so that her family can get ahead and become self-sufficient.\r\n<p>\r\nMember Rosalía C. is 36 years old, married and has a 16 year old daughter.  Her husband works in an auto body shop, repairing and painting cars.  Meanwhile, she works as a domestic helper and also sells Avon cosmetic products and other brands as well.  Her clients are primarily neighbors, friends and acquaintances.  She has been selling cosmetics for 8 years.  When she was younger she previously worked as a temporary employee, a salaried employee, and also in restaurants.  She also takes charge of the domestic duties for her own home. Rosalía works from 7:30am to 5pm.  She is requesting a loan of $220 to buy Avon products because she sells on credit.  Sometimes the company has promotions, so she can pay for the products now and recoup the costs afterwards when customers make their payments.  She takes orders from her customers every two weeks, which totals between $100-$120, of which 25% is profit.  (That figure is reduced between 5-10% after taking into account the costs of the products.)  This is the first time she has taken out a loan.  In the future she would like to open her own business, such as restaurant, because she enjoys cooking.\r\n<p>\r\nAll members have promised to pay their loans on time and in a responsible manner.\r\n<br /><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer</strong></p>;Operating capital;EC;Ecuador;Cuenca;standard;;137;8;131;;LUIS JERONIMO, JULIO CESAR, DELIA MARIA, JULIO ENRIQUE, MARIA TERESA, MERCEDES DE JESUS, MARIA ROSALIA, JOSE ISAIAS, ADEMIR FRANKLIN, MARIA TRANSITO, GLORIA ISABEL, TELMO VICENTE, CARMEN PATRICIA, VICTOR ALFONSO, PRISCILA ELIZABETH, ROMMEL GONZALO, LUIS MEDARDO;male, male, female, male, female, female, female, male, male, female, female, male, female, male, female, male, male;true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true;monthly;field_partner
